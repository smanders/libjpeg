 * Compression initialization.
 * Before calling this, all parameters and a data destination must be set up.
 *
 * We require a write_all_tables parameter as a failsafe check when writing
 * multiple datastreams from the same compression object.  Since prior runs
 * will have left all the tables marked sent_table=TRUE, a subsequent run
 * would emit an abbreviated stream (no tables) by default.  This may be what
 * is wanted, but for safety's sake it should not be the default behavior:
 * programmers should have to make a deliberate choice to emit abbreviated
 * images.  Therefore the documentation and examples should encourage people
 * to pass write_all_tables=TRUE; then it will take active thought to do the
 * wrong thing.
